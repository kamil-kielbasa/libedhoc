        * Support for RFC9528 (EDHOC):
          - EDHOC authentication only with signatures.
          - EDHOC authentication identified limited to: 'kid', 'x5chain', 'x5t'.
	* Separate interface for EAD.
        * Support for RFC9528 (EDHOC):
	  - EDHOC EAD compose & process.
	  - EDHOC message 4 compose & process.
	  - EDHOC keyUpdate method.
	* Verified with RFC9529 (EDHOC traces) chapter 2.
          - Extended unit tests with EAD single/multiple tokens.
        * Used RFC9529 (EDHOC traces) certificates to verify authentication with signatures X.509 identified by 'x5chain'.
        * Example implementation for EDHOC cipher suite 0 and 2.
        * EDHOC context structure private members.
        * Fix connection identifiers encoding option.
        * Fix authentiation credentials encoding option.
        * Fix CBOR memory requirements for integer, byte string and text string.

        Change summary for version 0.1.0:

        * EDHOC implementation for version 16.
          - supports only authentication with signatures.
          - supports EAD encoded as byte string.
          - support authentication identified by: 'kid', 'x5chain', 'x5t'.
        * EDHOC API is CoAP friendly.
        * Separate interfaces for:
          - cryptographics keys.
          - cryptographics operations.
          - authentication credentials.
        * Authentication credentials fetch callback accept only private key identifier.
        * Example implementation of cipher suite 0 with PSA.
        * Unit test with test vectors for authentication with signatures, X.509 identified by 'kid', 'x5chain' and 'x5t'.
