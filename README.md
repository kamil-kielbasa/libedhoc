# libedhoc: A C implementation of the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (RFC 9528)

## About libedhoc

**libedhoc** is a C implementation of a lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange with ephemeral keys for constrained devices. It provides mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and identity protection. This protocol, EDHOC, is standardized by the IETF as [RFC 9528](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9528). Code has been tested according to [RFC 9529](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9529).
